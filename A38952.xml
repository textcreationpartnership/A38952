            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Exact Relation of the GLORIOUS VICTORY Obtain'd upon the French and Iriſh Army BEFORE LONDON-DERRY, On <hi>Sunday, June</hi> the 2d, 1689. WITH An Account of Major-General <hi>KIRK</hi>'s Arrival at <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and the Number of Ships under his Command.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Liſenced and Entred according to Order.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Letters from <hi>Dublin</hi> ſay, That all Artifices are uſed to bring over the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, to eſpouſe the late King's Intereſt, but they are ineffectual, which is evident, for that there are in <hi>Ireland</hi> many thouſand Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, of which a great number are able to bear Arms, and amongſt them very many good Officers; yet hath not the late King ſince his Arrival in that Kingdom, with all his gilded offers of Protection, and Liberty of Conſcience, been able to prevail with Twenty Men of the Reformed Religion, to take up Arms for Defence of his Popiſh Cauſe, or aſſiſt to enſlave their Poſterities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> already behave themſelves with that haughty Inſolence in the Court, Camp, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as if they were entering on the Meritorious Service (as at home) of Dragooning the defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Proteſtants, and Lording it over the Native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> inſomuch, that their Biggotry and Loyalty begins to ſtagger, and the wiſer and wealthier of them think they are aſſiſting a Fatal Work to their Poſterity, and Countrey, wiſhing themſelves under a Proteſtant Protection again; the godly Monſieur ſtick not to ſay publickly, that <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot be bleſſed until there is not one damned Heretick left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Upon a modeſt Calculation, the Papiſt Army and Mobile, together, have already deſpoiled the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of their perſonal Eſtates in Money, Plate, Stock, and Houſhould-Goods, to the value of more than five hundred thouſand Pounds Sterling; and the Commiſſioners appointed in each County for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations, have ſequeſtred more than five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> of their real E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and are proceeding therein.</p>
            <p>And Orders are given for the ſeizing to the uſe of the late King what remains unplundered in the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all Proteſtants Abſenters; and the pretended Houſe of Commons have unanimouſly voted the Reſtitution of all Lands belonging to Abbeys, Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Monaſteries, and all other Religious Houſes throughout the Kingdom, which makes the Prieſts, Fryars, Monks, and the order of that diſorderly Crew to appear in ſuch Herd<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as if they were upon a General Muſter, and the numbers of Maſſes for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is incredible; but it's a Queſtion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether moſt are offered for the <hi>French</hi> King, or his Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>Amidſt all theſe their <hi>Halcyon</hi> hopes, the diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which appears in the moſt conſiderate of the Natives, the unanimous proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> the firmneſs and ſwift proceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Reſolution of the Garriſons of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and <hi>Inniskilling,</hi> whoſe Courage hath deſtroyed the flower of their Army, &amp; diſcouraged the reſt, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they have loſt before <hi>Derry,</hi> and elſewhere 10000 Horſe, Foot, and Dragoons moſt killed, ſome wounded, ſome taken, and ſome deſerted. And it's
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108807:2"/>credited at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that the Siege is raiſed, and the rather, for that ſome harraſſed Troops of Horſe (ſome wanting above half their number) are come thither from before <hi>Derry,</hi> and are ordered to joyn the Camp that is forming near <hi>Dublin,</hi> and there to be filled up, whiles Recruits are marching to the Northward, to Reinforce the Army.</p>
            <p>The Account credited at <hi>Dublin</hi> concerning the late Action near <hi>Ballyſhannon</hi> is, That there are in <hi>Inniskilling</hi> 4000 Foot well Arm'd, and above 1000 Horſe, of as brave ſtout Men from the Northern Borders of both Kingdoms, as any are in <hi>Europe,</hi> and commanded by Col. <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> Capt. <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and many other brave Officers, who have made frequent and ſucceſsful Sallies upon the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> particularly in <hi>May</hi> laſt, upon the Occaſion follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Inniskilling</hi> having gotten together a great Stock of Proviſions of all ſorts at <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> which they deſigned to get thither by Water; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> got Notice thereof, and with a ſtrong Party of 12, ſome ſay 1500 Horſe and Dragoons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Col. <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> reſolved to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters thereof, and were on their March ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. But Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> drew out of the Town all the Horſe he had, and a conſiderable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Foot, and Attaqued them ſo Opportunely, and with that Courage and Reſolution, that they were ſoon forced in Diſorder and Confuſion, and the Foot coming up and ſecuring a Paſs, the whole Party was entirely defeated, <hi>Sarsfield</hi> and five or ſix more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcaping, the reſt being moſt killed, and about 200 taken, the beſt of which they kept, and the reſt they ſtript and ſent away to carry the News to their Friends. In this Action they got many good Horſes, Arms, and Plunder, and have gotten home their Proviſions; ſince which, at a place called <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-Shani,</hi> they attaqued and routed a Detachment that was marching to the Army, and took from them ſome Cannon and Bombs, 100 Priſoners, and as many killed; of both which Actions they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an Account to <hi>Derry,</hi> and that they are in good Heart, and, if poſſible, will joyn them in a few days, and take the Field with what Forces they can make, and bring Proviſions with them.</p>
            <p>Letters from <hi>Cheſter</hi> ſay, That on the <hi>31st.</hi> paſt, about 3 in the Morning, the Wind at South-Eaſt, a brisk Gale, Major-Gen. <hi>Kirk</hi> failed from <hi>High Lake,</hi> having with him 3 Men of War, and 24 Ships of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, on whom are Embarqued the Major-General's Regiment, Sir <hi>John Hanmore</hi>'s, and Col. <hi>Stewart</hi>'s, and the reſt of the Forces, with Gunners, Engineers, and a great quantity of Proviſions, Arms, Ammunition, Bombs, Cannon, Morters, Ball, Pick-axes, and Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</p>
            <p>Laſt Night, being <hi>June</hi> the Fifth, came an Advice from <hi>Liverpool,</hi> ſent in there by the <hi>Portland-Frigate,</hi> with the account fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi> That being cruiſing on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſt, ſhe met with Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the firſt inſtant, at Ten in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning off of <hi>Carrick-Fergus</hi> Bay, with the whole Fleet, under a good Wind for <hi>London-Derry,</hi> where they in all probability arrived on Sabbath-day.</p>
            <p>There is certain Advice from <hi>London-Derry,</hi> That the Proteſtants in <hi>London-Derry</hi> having Notice on Sabbath-day Morning, <hi>June</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> and the Fleet under his Command, were arrived within the Harbour's Mouth, called a Council of War, and reſolved to make a Sally on the Enemy; which they executed with all the whole Force of the Garriſon (about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men excepted) and with that deſperate Courage and Reſolution, that they fell pell-mell upon the Enemy in their Trenches, and beat them off from their Three Batteries, and out of all their Trenches, took all their Mortars and Guns: And ſo bloody and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate was the Fight, that the Proteſtants loſt about 1500 Men, and the Enemy 6000, ſome account 5000, but the leaſt above 4000 dead on the ſpot.</p>
            <p>After which the Enemy diſcamped with their whole Army in a very great diſorder and confuſion, leaving behind them all their Bag and Baggage, of which the Proteſtants are now the Maſters, and of the Field eight Miles round.</p>
            <p>This Good News is brought by the <hi>Dublin</hi> Yatch, Captain <hi>Rice</hi> Commander, who went with Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> to <hi>Derry,</hi> and left them in the Harbour on Sabbath-day night, intending to land on <hi>Munday</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Particulars of this Great and Glorious Action is expected next Poſt from <hi>Derry,</hi> with the true ſtate of the Garriſon.</p>
            <p>The Letters from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> do affirm, That yeſterday, <hi>June</hi> the Fifth, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet conſiſting of Forty Ships of War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came to the <hi>Spitt-head,</hi> where the reciprocal Joy and Friendſhip of each Fleet, was loudly proclaimed by their Cannon.</p>
